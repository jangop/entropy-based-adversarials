# Entropy-based Adversarial Attacks
This repository contains code to perform entropy-based localized adversarial
attacks, code to setup and perform a study to investigate the perceptibility of
adversarial perturbations, and the results of such a (small-scale) study. The
method is based on the publication [Adversarial attacks hidden in plain
sight](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09286), which includes the results of the
study. If anything in this repository helps you, please cite the paper:
